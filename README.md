#TABULA
A game for all those with too much time on their hands... Especially this version. 
Written as part of a First Year programming module in the Durham University Computer Science dept.

To start, run the 'Game' class.
RULES: 
1. Set the two players (either two computers, one computer one player, two players) as directed on screen.
2. Start game.
3. Game aim is to get all 15 pieces from the start box to the end. 
4. A pair of dice are rolled, and the resulting numbers on the dice can be used to move that many places forward. If a double is rolled, you take 4 moves. You must use all moves. Press the corresponding number on your keyboard to choose a move.
5. You may either move multiple pieces or the same pieces. The game will only allow legal moves (ie you cannot land on a space with more than one of the opponents pieces). It will reset your turn if you play an illegal move.
6. If the opponent has only one piece on a space, you may land on that space, kicking the opponent into the holding area. The opponents next turn must be spent removing the piece from the holding area, and they start at space 1 from there. Tabula
